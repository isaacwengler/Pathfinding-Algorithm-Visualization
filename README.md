# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

With this application, you can see the processes of Dijkstras Algorithm, A* Search, and more as they try to find the shortest path. You can make obstacles and mazes for the algorithms to work around.

I build this web-application using React. During this I learned React.js as well as several pathfinding algorithms!

Click anywhere on the grid to make walls, choose an algorithm, and visualize it.
